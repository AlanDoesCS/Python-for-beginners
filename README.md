Also our school pays for a code editor called "PyCharm" which anyone from our school can use even if they don't take computer science, and I'd really recommend it over other code editors just because it makes everything so much nicer:

## Good starting points:
- [W3Schools, (great because it starts with the basics but u can skip to harder stuff based on ur skill level)](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)
- [Sololearn, (not too bad for just checking you know all the terminology and syntax)](https://www.sololearn.com/en/)
- []()

## Coding examples (stars indicate difficulty)
_(I recommend not just following the tutorials but also changing some of the stuff and seeing what happens and trying to add new features)_
Introduction to data types:
- [Lists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OeznAkyQz4)

- :star::star: [How to use the time module to get what time it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj3GlL5ckQA)
- :star::star::star: [Simple login system using python  , (the guy is kind boring so maybe just speed it up to like 1.25x)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keY_RKilMp0)

## Code challenges:
### Calculator:
:star::
1. Make a program to add 2 numbers that are inputted into the terminal
2. Make a program to multiply 2 numbers that are inputted into the terminal
3. Make a program to divide 2 numbers that are inputted into the terminal

:star::star::
4. Make a program that (tip: use the built in `.split()` method to get a list of things inputted)
5. Edit the program so it can detect specific operators and perform the corresponding operation (e.g " + " adds, " * " multiplies, " / " divides)
6. Edit the program so it can take more than 2 numbers to operate on

:star::star::star::star::
7. Make it follow the correct order of operations (BIDMAS / PEMDAS) - Feel free to ask me about this as it can be quite complicated

### Basic Operating System (OS):
:star::
1. Get the user to enter a username and display a welcome message (e.g. "`Welcome, John`")
2.
