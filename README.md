# Python-for-beginners
A list of resources for beginner python programmers, who want a practical approach to learning the language.


# List of resources:
## _(If you ever are confused about something, just ask! I don't mind :D )_

If you are looking for a code editor, I would highly recommand PyCharm (the editor that I personally use) or Visual Studio Code. PyCharm is paid, but is easier to use in my opinion.

## Good starting points:
- [W3Schools, (great because it starts with the basics but u can skip to harder stuff based on ur skill level)](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)
- [Sololearn, (not too bad for just checking you know all the terminology and syntax)](https://www.sololearn.com/en/)
- []()

## Coding examples (stars indicate difficulty)
_(I recommend not just following the tutorials but also changing some of the stuff and seeing what happens and trying to add new features)_
Introduction to data types:
- [Lists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OeznAkyQz4)

- :star::star: [How to use the time module to get what time it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj3GlL5ckQA)
- :star::star::star: [Simple login system using python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keY_RKilMp0)

## Code challenges:
### Calculator:
:star::
1. Make a program to add 2 numbers that are inputted into the terminal
2. Make a program to multiply 2 numbers that are inputted into the terminal
3. Make a program to divide 2 numbers that are inputted into the terminal

:star::star::

4. Make a program that (tip: use the built in `.split()` method to get a list of things inputted)
5. Edit the program so it can detect specific operators and perform the corresponding operation (e.g " + " adds, " * " multiplies, " / " divides)
6. Edit the program so it can take more than 2 numbers to operate on

:star::star::star::star::

7. Make it follow the correct order of operations (BIDMAS / PEMDAS) - Feel free to ask me about this as it can be quite complicated

### Basic Pseudo-Operating-System:
:star::
1. Get the user to enter a username and display a welcome message (e.g. "`Welcome, John`")
2. Create a simple command line interface with a `help` command that lists all available actions
    - 2.1. `eval` : solves a mathematical expression
    - 2.2. implement the basic UNIX commands (`touch`, `ls`, ...)
